description="Galaxy Build. Back from the dead. Simple Kodi experience designed for watching/listening to nearly anything imaginable. Greetz: MGRAM, MPL, LSTRG, APL, SHK, SCB, G1027, and the rest of BBS. Report all bugs to the man behind the curtain. If you're downloading this, you probably know the dev, one would hope. Shoutouts to all addon developers; without them, this wouldn't be happening. Updates. Expect them."
